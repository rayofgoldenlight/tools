purpose: allow a user to record and access the infrared camera on their windows-based device

can run the program by typing it's name in command prompt
-------------
just type:
camera_tool
-------------
or if in msys2 mingw64 window do:
./camera_tool
-------------
and the program will start running
- make sure you are in the same directory as the executable

currently the program just works for certain windows-based infrared-camera-installed devices

if you have a black dot (the infrared sensor) next to your camera, this program may work for you
most likely have it if your device has facial login

--------------------------------------------------
if you want to modify:

to compile the current program in msys2 mingw64:
gcc main.c camera_select.c camera_formats.c ir_capture.c -o camera_tool.exe \
    -lsetupapi -lcfgmgr32 \
    -lmf -lmfplat -lmfreadwrite -lmfuuid -lole32 -luuid \
    -luser32 -lgdi32 -lavifil32

notes on what the code does:
main.c: orchestrator
1.) camera_select.c: find cameras avaliable
2.) camera_formats.c: checks the format of the camera
3.) ir_capture.c: shows camera feed and gives option to record feed to a AVI video file
ir_capture.h: defines PreviewIRCamera
